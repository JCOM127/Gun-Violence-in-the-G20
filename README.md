## Comparing US Homicides with Developed G20 Nations

Hereby, we can observe an independant look on how to obtain free booze by using basic statistics, open source data and abundance of free time. This study aims to analyze and compare homicide rates (both gun-related and total) in the United States with other developed countries within the G20, using Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure of development. Our hypothesis is that the United States will exhibit a significantly higher homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants compared to its developed counterparts.

### Motivation:

- The United States stands out within the G20 by consistently registering significantly higher homicide rates than other developed nations.
- Understanding the potential factors contributing to this disparity can inform public policy discussions and potentially guide interventions to reduce violence.
- Bets and booze motivated entirely by a happy US taxpayer.


### Data and Methodology:

- We will utilize relevant datasets on homicides (total and gun-related), population figures, and HDI rankings for G20 member countries.
- Statistical analyses will be employed to compare homicide rates across countries, taking into account HDI levels and potentially controlling for other relevant factors.
- Visualization techniques like boxplots and scatter plots will be used to showcase the relationships between variables.

### Expected Outcomes:

- This analysis aims to provide empirical evidence supporting or refuting the hypothesis.
- It will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex issue of violent crime in the United States relative to its developed peers.

### Limitations:

- Data availability and quality can influence the analysis.
- Controlling for all potential confounding factors was not fully possible.
- Generalizability of findings to broader populations must be carefully considered.
- Overall, this study aims to shed light on the concerningly high homicide rates in the United States compared to other developed nations within the G20. By employing rigorous data analysis and - visualization, we hope to contribute to a more informed discussion and potential solutions to tackle this complex issue.
